- ✅ `LOCAL_SETUP_WINDOWS.md` - Windows-specific setup

### Configuration:
- ✅ `.gitignore` - Excludes large files (dataset, models)

---

## 🚫 What Was NOT Uploaded (Intentionally)

These files are excluded via `.gitignore` because they're too large for GitHub:

### Dataset:
- ❌ `data/` - 8,479 fruit images (~2 GB)
- ❌ `Fruits-detection/` - Original YOLO dataset

### Generated Files:
- ❌ `*.png` - Generated visualizations
- ❌ `*.keras` - Trained model (55 MB)
- ❌ `*.h5` - Model checkpoints

**Why excluded?**
- GitHub has a 100 MB file size limit
- Dataset is available on Kaggle
- Users can generate their own models and images
