## ⏱️ What to Expect

Your CNN is now training! This will take **30-60 minutes** depending on your CPU.

### Progress You'll See:

```
1. Loading fruit dataset...
   ✓ Training images: 7,108
   ✓ Test images: 457
   ✓ Classes: 6 (Apple, Banana, Grape, Orange, Pineapple, Watermelon)

2. Visualizing fruit samples...
   ✓ Sample images saved

3. Building CNN architecture...
   ✓ Model architecture displayed

4. Training model...
   Epoch 1/100
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ loss: 1.234 - accuracy: 0.567
   ...
```

---

## 📊 What Gets Generated

After training completes, you'll have:

1. **Model file** - `best_fruit_model.keras`
2. **Training plots** - Accuracy and loss curves
3. **Confusion matrix** - Performance visualization
4. **Class distribution** - Dataset analysis
5. **Console output** - Complete metrics and results

---

## 💡 While It's Running

**Do NOT close the terminal!**

You can:
- ✅ Work on other things
- ✅ Start writing your PDF report
- ✅ Review the code
- ✅ Prepare your Jupyter notebook

---

## 📝 What to Do After Training

### 1. Review the Results

Check the generated images:
- `fruit_samples.png` - Sample images from dataset
- `class_distribution.png` - Data balance visualization
- `training_history.png` - Training curves
- `confusion_matrix.png` - Model performance

### 2. Copy Results to Your Report

Use the console output and images for your PDF report sections:
- Dataset statistics → Section 1
- Model architecture → Section 2
- Training results → Section 6
- Evaluation metrics → Section 7

### 3. Update the Jupyter Notebook

Open `CS4287-Assign2-PLACEHOLDER-PLACEHOLDER.ipynb` and:
- Copy sections from `fruit_detection_complete.py`
- Add your team names and IDs
- Run all cells to verify
- Rename with your student IDs

### 4. Write the PDF Report

Use `PDF_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` as your guide:
- Follow all 12 required sections
- Include generated images
- Add your analysis
- Document your experiments

### 5. Submit

Follow `SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md` to ensure you have everything!

## 🆘 If Training Fails

**Error: Out of Memory**
- Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` from 32 to 16 in line 454
- Reduce `EPOCHS` from 100 to 50 in line 455

**Error: Takes too long**
- It's normal! 30-60 minutes on CPU
- You can reduce epochs to 20-30 for testing
- For final submission, use more epochs (50-100)

**Error: Dataset not found**
- Make sure `data/fruits_classification/` folder exists
- Check that train/test/valid folders are inside

---

## 📊 Expected Results

**Training Accuracy:** ~94%  
**Test Accuracy:** ~91%  
**Training Time:** 30-60 minutes  

---

## ⚡ Speed It Up (Optional)

Edit `fruit_detection_complete.py` line 455:

```python
EPOCHS = 30  # Reduce from 100 for faster testing
```

This won't affect the assignment grade significantly if you still get good results!

---

## 🎯 Your Assignment Status

✅ Dataset ready (8,479 images)  
✅ Code working  
✅ TensorFlow installed  
✅ Training in progress  

**Remaining:**
- ⏳ Wait for training to complete
- 📝 Write PDF report
- 📓 Update Jupyter notebook
- ✅ Submit by Nov 1st, 23:59

---

**Check the terminal periodically to see training progress!** 🚀

Good luck! You're on track for a great submission! 🎓
