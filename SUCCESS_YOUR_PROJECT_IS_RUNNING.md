## 📈 What to Expect

### Progress Display:
```
Epoch 1/100
223/223 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 45s 198ms/step 
  - loss: 1.5234 - accuracy: 0.4567 - top_3_accuracy: 0.8123 
  - val_loss: 1.2345 - val_accuracy: 0.5678

Epoch 2/100
223/223 ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 42s 187ms/step
  - loss: 1.1234 - accuracy: 0.6789 - top_3_accuracy: 0.9012
  ...
```

### Typical Progress:
- **Epochs 1-10:** Fast improvement (accuracy 40% → 70%)
- **Epochs 10-30:** Steady gains (accuracy 70% → 85%)
- **Epochs 30-50:** Refinement (accuracy 85% → 92%)
- **Epochs 50+:** Fine-tuning (accuracy 92% → 94%)

### Callbacks:
- **ReduceLROnPlateau:** Will reduce learning rate if stuck
- **EarlyStopping:** Will stop if not improving for 15 epochs
- **ModelCheckpoint:** Saves best model automatically

## 💻 System Load

While training, you'll notice:
- **High CPU usage** (80-100%) - This is normal!
- **Memory usage** ~2-3 GB
- **Disk writes** for saving checkpoints
- **Fan noise** increased (CPU working hard)

**This is all expected and normal!**

---

## 🎯 Generated Files

After training completes, you'll find:

### Images:
- `fruit_samples.png` - Sample images from dataset
- `class_distribution.png` - Bar chart of class distribution
- `training_history.png` - Accuracy and loss curves
- `confusion_matrix.png` - Performance heatmap

### Model:
- `best_fruit_model.keras` - Trained model weights (~55 MB)

### Console Output:
- Complete training log with all metrics
- Final evaluation results
- Classification report
- Per-class precision, recall, F1-score

---

## 📝 While You Wait (30-60 min)

### ✅ Things You Can Do Now:

1. **Start Your PDF Report**
   - Open `PDF_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md`
   - Write Section 1 (Dataset) using the console output
   - Prepare Section 2 (Network Architecture) skeleton

2. **Prepare Your Jupyter Notebook**
   - Open `CS4287-Assign2-PLACEHOLDER-PLACEHOLDER.ipynb`
   - Add your team names and student IDs
   - Add execution status comment
   - Add dataset source link

3. **Review the Code**
   - Read through `fruit_detection_complete.py`
   - Understand each section
   - Prepare your code comments for the notebook
   - Note any questions for your teammate

4. **Plan Your Experiments**
   - Think about which hyperparameters to test
   - Plan your analysis for Section 8
   - Consider data augmentation strategies

5. **Check Progress Periodically**
   - Look at the terminal every 10 minutes
   - Note the accuracy progression
   - Watch for any errors

---

## 🔍 Monitoring Training

### Check the Terminal to See:
- Current epoch number (X/100)
- Training accuracy increasing
- Validation accuracy tracking training
- Loss decreasing
- Time per epoch

### Good Signs:
- ✅ Accuracy increasing each epoch
- ✅ Loss decreasing steadily
- ✅ Validation accuracy close to training accuracy (~3% gap)
- ✅ No error messages

### Warning Signs:
- ⚠️ Validation accuracy much lower than training (>10% gap) = Overfitting
- ⚠️ Loss not decreasing = Learning rate too high or too low
- ⚠️ Very slow progress = Normal on CPU, but check system resources

---

## 🎓 Expected Final Results

Based on your dataset and architecture:

| Metric | Expected Value |
|--------|----------------|
| Training Accuracy | 92-96% |
| Validation Accuracy | 88-93% |
| Test Accuracy | 88-92% |
| Top-3 Accuracy | 96-99% |
| Training Time | 30-60 minutes |
| Model Size | 55 MB |

## 🚨 If Something Goes Wrong

### Error: Out of Memory
```python
# Edit line 454 in fruit_detection_complete.py:
BATCH_SIZE = 16  # Reduce from 32
```

### Error: Takes too long
```python
# Edit line 455:
EPOCHS = 30  # Reduce from 100 for testing
```

### Error: Training stuck
- Check if accuracy is changing at all
- If frozen for >5 minutes, press Ctrl+C and restart
- May need to reduce learning rate

---

## 📋 After Training Completes

### Immediate Steps:

1. **Check the generated files:**
   ```bash
   ls *.png
   ls *.keras
   ```

2. **Review the console output** - scroll back to see:
   - Final test accuracy
   - Classification report
   - Confusion matrix values

3. **Copy results to your report:**
   - Take screenshots of confusion matrix
   - Copy accuracy/loss plots
   - Note final metrics

4. **Update your notebook:**
   - Copy code sections
   - Add comments explaining each part
   - Run all cells to verify

5. **Follow the submission checklist:**
   - Open `SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Check off each requirement
   - Ensure nothing is missing
