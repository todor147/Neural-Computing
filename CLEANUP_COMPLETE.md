## 🎯 What To Do Next

### 1. Install Dependencies (if needed)
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow jupyter notebook
```

### 2. Run the Code
```bash
python fruit_detection_complete.py
```

### 3. Prepare Notebook for Submission
1. Open `CS4287-Assign2-PLACEHOLDER-PLACEHOLDER.ipynb`
2. Update first cells with:
   - Your team names and student IDs
   - "Code executes to completion without errors"
   - Dataset source link
3. Rename to: `CS4287-Assign2-[ID1]-[ID2].ipynb`
4. Run all cells to verify

### 4. Write PDF Report
Use `PDF_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md` as your guide - it has:
- Complete structure matching assignment spec
- Example content for each section
- Tips for what to include

### 5. Final Check
Go through `SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md` and check every box!
